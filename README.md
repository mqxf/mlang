# OUTDATED
I have since started to remake this with v22, which can be seen in my new repository mvln-coby


# mlang
Compiler for the mlang programming language. This compiler will turn it into assembly (.s) which can then be compiled further with GCC or another assembler and linker.

For now I'm following someone else who made a compiler, so the code will be similar, however, I plan on expanding this a lot more, with more functions and uses. So while at the start this will be similar to https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvaIU2QC2uvFnVxXe-XzXJfd4dXGz5qBB, in the future it will start to vary more with added features and functionality. I'm using the playlist as a sort of "guide" to both know where to start, and learn how to turn this into assembly (as I'm not good with it). But for example already there are way more tokens, and the main function also has more available arguments (for both input and optional output file).
